# Handwritten-Recognition project for Intro to AI

## Repository Structure
There are three python programs for each algorithm:
  - Convolutional Neural Network
  - K Nearest-Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine
Each algorithm has a file for
  - mnist (0 - 10, balanced)
  - upnum (0 - 10 + uppercase, unbalanced)
  - balanced (0 - 10 + lowercase + uppercase, balanced)
These can each be run depending on the desired dataset.

## Required dependencies 
 - First you will need the dataset. It can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/ashwani07/emnist-using-keras-cnn/data
  - This the CSV data files **MUST** be in a parent folder called "EMNISTcsv"
 - The library dependencies can call be installed via PIP
  - Numpy
  - skimage
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - keras
  - tensorflow
  - sklearn
 - much of the code was written in a Mac environment so we cannot be certain that the file paths work on Windows.
